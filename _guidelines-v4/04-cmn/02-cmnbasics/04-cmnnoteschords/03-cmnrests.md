The **@dur** attribute on {% include link elem="rest" %} captures the written duration of the rest and allows the same values as on {% include link elem="note" %} and {% include link elem="chord" %}. The CMN module also makes three more elements available for special forms of rest:

{% include desc elem="mRest" %}
{% include desc elem="multiRest" %}
{% include desc elem="mSpace" %}
