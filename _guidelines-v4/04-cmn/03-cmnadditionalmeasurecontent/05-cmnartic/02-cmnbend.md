A bend is a variation in pitch (often microtonal) upwards or downwards during the course of a note. Typically, the performer attacks the note at ‘true’ pitch, changes the intonation, then returns to true pitch. The {% include link elem="bend" %} element can also be used for so-called scoop, plop, falloff, and doit performance effects. It should *not* be used for laissez vibrer (l.v.) indications. As with other elements in the {% include link model="controlEventLike" %} class, the starting point of the bend may be indicated by either a **@tstamp**, **@tstamp.ges**, **@tstamp.real** or **@startid** attribute. It is a semantic error not to specify a starting attribute.
